# REST Interface

The Workbench provides a REST API.

## Workspace

All resources below are available under the path `{deploymentURI}/workspace/`.

### Manage Projects

| Resource                    | Description                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET projects`              | Retrieves a JSON listing all projects in the workspace and their tasks by type |
| `PUT projects/<project>`    | Adds a new empty project                                                       |   
| `DELETE projects/<project>` | Delets an existing project                                                     |

### Resources

Each project may contain a number of resources (i.e. files). 
Resources may be referenced by tasks in the workspace.
For instance, a dataset may read a CSV-file or a linkage rule may read a stopword list.

| Resource                                      | Description                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET projects/<project>/resources `           | Retrieves a JSON listing all resources in a project. |
| `GET projects/<project>/resources/<name> `    | Retrieves a specific resource.                       |   
| `PUT projects/<project>/resources/<name> `    | Uploads a specific resource.                         |   
| `DELETE projects/<project>/resources/<name> ` | Deletes a specific resource.                         |   

### Datasets

A dataset description holds all properties needed to read entities from a dataset.
The dataset may either be local (e.g., a resource) or remote (e.g., accessed through queries).

| Resource                                     | Description                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GET projects/<project>/datasets/<name> `    | Retrieves the properties of a specific dataset. |   
| `PUT projects/<project>/datasets/<name> `    | Creates or updates a dataset.                   |   
| `DELETE projects/<project>/datasets/<name> ` | Deletes a dataset.                              |   

### Start/Stop Activities

Each project or task may provide one or more activities. An activity is a unit of work that can be executed in the background.

| Resource                  | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST activities/start`   | Starts an activity.                                                   |
| `POST activities/cancel`  | Cancels an activity.                                                  |
| `GET activities/config`   | Retrieves the configuration of an activity as key-value pairs.        |
| `POST activities/config`  | Updates the configuration of an activity.                             |
| `GET activities/status`   | Retrieves the status of an activity.                                  |
| `GET activities/updates`  | Retrieves a Comet stream of Javascript calls to updateStatus whenever |
|                           | the status changes. Can be used to avoid status polling.              |

All resources support three parameters:

- `project`: The project name.
- `task`: The task name. If left empty, a project activity is retrieved.
- `activity`: The name of the activity.

Example for starting the `Generate Links` activity for the LinkMovies task:

    POST activities/start?project=MyProject&task=LinkMovies&activity=Generate%20Links
